These test cases have been taken from version 0.10.0 of the
YamlReference Haskell package.

Several test-case files have been renamed to match the names in the
YAML 1.2 specification:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  ns-l-in-line-mapping.n=2.input           -> ns-l-compact-mapping.n=2.input
  ns-l-in-line-mapping.n=2.invalid.input   -> ns-l-compact-mapping.n=2.invalid.input
  ns-l-in-line-mapping.n=2.invalid.output  -> ns-l-compact-mapping.n=2.invalid.output
  ns-l-in-line-mapping.n=2.output          -> ns-l-compact-mapping.n=2.output
  ns-l-in-line-sequence.n=3.input          -> ns-l-compact-sequence.n=3.input
  ns-l-in-line-sequence.n=3.invalid.input  -> ns-l-compact-sequence.n=3.invalid.input
  ns-l-in-line-sequence.n=3.invalid.output -> ns-l-compact-sequence.n=3.invalid.output
#+END_EXAMPLE
